# Weather & News Lab (Lab 4) - AI Version

This is a simple single-page app that shows current weather for Troy, NY and a grid of top news headlines. But instead, uses AI to create all of the files for me.

# Notes
 - TheNewsAPI may not be able to retrieve any data due to it being a free API and there being a limited amount of API calls.

# Logs (Prompts)

 - Given the assignment guidelines, can you create for me a 3 file webpage using the OpenWeather API key that I will provide, as well as a TheNewsAPI key that I will also provide. Be sure to use Bootstrap, simple HTML, CSS, and javascript to organize the page and make it visually pleasing. Also provide the files separately
 - From now on, can you refer to the css and JS directory as ../resources/styles/aiStyle.css and ../resources/scripts/aiIndex.js respectively. 
 - Can you add more information for the city when the city is searched? and convert the units to imperial. And also display the next few days of forecast too.
 - it looks like the js file is returning the wrong format, can you rewrite my js file to make the next 5 days in line and also print 5 day only once?
 - Implement a clickable feature to the 5 day forecast cards so that "day details" pop up after clicking on the card. Make it like an extension off the site and add an option at the top right to click out of the pop-up screen.
 - Can you rewrite the 3 files so that this is implemented?
