# Weather & News Lab (Lab 4) - AI Version

This is a simple single-page app that shows current weather for Troy, NY and a grid of top news headlines. But instead, uses AI to create all of the files for me.

# Logs

 - First: Given the assignment guidelines, can you create for me a 3 file webpage using the OpenWeather API key that I will provide, as well as a TheNewsAPI key that I will also provide. Be sure to use Bootstrap, simple HTML, CSS, and javascript to organize the page and make it visually pleasing. Also provide the files separately
 - Second: Can you add more information for the city when the city is searched? and convert the units to imperial. And also display the next few days of forecast too.
