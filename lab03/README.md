# Weather & News Lab (Lab 3)

This is a simple single-page app that shows current weather for Troy, NY and a grid of top news headlines.

## Files of interest

- `lab03/weather-app.html` — main page (Bootstrap layout)
- `resources/styles/weather.css` — small custom styles
- `resources/scripts/weather.js` — fetches OpenWeatherMap and TheNewsAPI, parses JSON, and renders the UI

## APIs used

- OpenWeatherMap (weather) — https://openweathermap.org/api
- TheNewsAPI (news) — https://thenewsapi.com/documentation

## Notes

- API keys are present in `resources/scripts/weather.js` for convenience. Remove or replace them before publishing.
- The app uses Bootstrap (CDN) for layout and visuals.
- Weather/News API keys may or may not work due to them being free API keys with limited calls
