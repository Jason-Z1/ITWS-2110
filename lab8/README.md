# Lab 8 – SQL and PHP

This lab uses **MySQL** (via XAMPP) and **PHP** to build a simple course / student / grades database and display query results on a web page. The XAMPP Control Panel allows me to run Apache and MySQL to access phpmyadmin.

## How the environment was setup

1. Start command prompt and run as administrator
2. Type 
```bash
mklink /D "C:\xampp\htdocs\lab8" "{path of WebSys\lab8 folder}"
```
This links the local folder to the localhost that is ran by Apache
3. Create and edit tables in localhost/phpmyadmin

## Document

I wasn't sure what commands and output one of the questions on the directions was referring to, so I just dumped the output of what the last few questions on Part 2 asked into a document.
